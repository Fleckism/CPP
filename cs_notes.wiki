** terminology **

3 building blocks of programming:  sequence, selection, iteration.

Function:  Is a named sequence of statements.
type identifier (parameter-list) {function body}

** Thoughts **

Solving problems:  How to represent data in memory?
- Calendar, a year as a vector of 12 months.
a month a vector of 30 days, days a vector of 24 hours.


Understand what the function: Does, needs, and returns, what errors, and what performance constraints.


Inheritance "is-a" relationship
Composition "has-a" relationship? NO idea what that shit is?

Difference between #include <bar> and #include "bar"
  #include <bar> looks into system folders first.
  #include "bar" looks into current or custom folders first.


Expression:  A combination of numbers, symbols, or other variables that produce a result when evaluated.


Variables are important in programming because they let you perform operations on data that may change


Scripts smallest components:  variables, expressions and operations.

Recursion and Iteration both repeatedly execute the set of instructions.  
	Recursion is when a statement in a function calls itself repeatedly.

	Iteration is when a loop repeatedly executes until the controlling condition becomes false.

Algorithm:  A process or set of rules to be followed in calculation or other problem-solving operations.
