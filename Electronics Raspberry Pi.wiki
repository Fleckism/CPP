= Electronics/ Pi =
Series circuits:  Current (i) stays the same.
   Voltage (v) is the sum of the voltage drops
   Resistance(r) is the sum of all the individual resistance
 
Parallel circuits:  Voltage (v) doesn't change.
  Current (i)  see Ohm's law
  Resistance(r) will always be the value of the smallest resistor.
  
Define voltage, current, and resistance.

Voltage:  water =charge
                 pressure=voltage
                flow=current(amps

Volts = force
Ohms = resistance
Watts = power
Ampere's = current
