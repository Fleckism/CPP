= Data Types=
	* What are the best types to use to store my data
	* enum's, array's, vectors, bool, char, floats, remember you can always rename a type
	* Use the smallest type needed
	* shorts are converted to int if artimatic is done on it.  Which increases cpu cycles.  Don't use short if there is math
	* 

= Flow Control =
	* Figure out when to use an if else, and when to use a switch
	* Switch statements can only be used with int's char's or enumerators
	* Use the break word "continue" or "jump" if you want to skip something in a loop like the number 5 out of printing 1 to 10
	*
