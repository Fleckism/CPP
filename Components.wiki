[[Chips]]
- Analog sensors cannot connect directly to the RPi. An _*ADC*_(Analog to digital converter) is needed
- 
- LDR Sensor module:  An analog input sensor, dark high resistance(1 M ohm, brigh low resistance.
- ADC:   Analog to digital converter.
- PWM:  Pulse width modulation with softPWM.  Used to control the speed of a motor or LED output.
- 1 is closed, 0 is open.
- L298N IC consists of two H-bridges
- 16 x 2 LCD or with I2C LCD module
- Ultra sonic measures out t 180 cm(70":w




- MCP3008 8 channel 10 bit ADC
