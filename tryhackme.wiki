= Learning Cyber Security =

- Type of web requestrs
- 	GET,POST,DELETE
- Basic _segmentation_ flaw
= What is Networking =
- Every device has two means of ID
- 	IP Adress (Internet Protocol) IPv4 Made up of 4 Octets 192.168.1.1 Like a person name
- 	Media Access Control (MAC) Address Like a person fingerprint assigned at the factory it was built 
 	- The IP is used as a logical identifier
	- The MAC is used as a physical identifier
	- The MAC is a 12 character hexadecimal number
	- The first six represent the company that made the network interface, the last 6 are unique
************************************************************************************************
- *Ping* uses ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices.
= Intro into LAN Local Area Network =
- Star Topology
	- Devices individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or a hub
	- Any information sent via central device
	- More expensive than other topologies
	- More scalable
	- More maintenance
	- Robust centralised hardware
- Bus Topology
	- Like leaves on a trea each device (leave) is attached to a backbone cable (branch)
	- Prone to bottlenecked
	- Difficult to troubleshoot
	- Little redunancy in place in case of failures
	- can't handle large amounts of data
- Ring Topology aka token
	- Troubleshooting is easy

- What is a switch
	- Dedicated devices that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices.
	- More efficient than hubs/repeaters
	- Keep track of what device is connect to which port.
	- Send packets to intended target
- What is a router
	- Connects networks and pass data between them.
	- Routing is the process of data travelling across networks.
	- 
	
= Subnetting =
- Is when you split up networks into smaller, miniature networks within itself
- subnet mask is of octets just like an IP address, 4 bytes(32bits), ranging from 0 to 255
	- Subnets use IP address
		- Identify the network address:  Start of network ends with 0
		- Identify the host address:  Identify a device on the subnet first 3 octets are the same
		- Identify the default gateway: Special address that is capable of sending information to
another network, last octet is different .254
- Benefits:  Efficiency, security, full control

= ARP Protocol =
- Address Resoluton Protocol
- ARP allows devices to identify themselves on a network
- Allows devices to associate MAC with IP address on a network
- 	Each device on a network keeps a log of the MAC address associated with other devices
-   ARP Request
- 	ARP Reply

= DHCP Protocol =
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol server
- DHCP Discover: To see if any DHCP servers are on the network
- DHCP Offer:  DHCP server replies back with an IP address the device could use
- DHCP Request:  The device replies confirming it wants the offered IP Address
- DHCP ACK:  The DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging it has been completed.

 = Look up =
 
-Enumerate machines and networks
