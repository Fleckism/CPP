Note: Observe the new keyword protected, which we have used in place of private. Recall that
only the class itself and friends can access data members in the private area. This would prevent
a derived class from accessing the data members. We do not want such a restriction with a class that is
designed for the purposes of inheritance and the derivation of child classes. After all, what good is
inheriting properties and methods you cannot access?. In order to achieve the same effect as
private, but allow derived classes to access the data members, C++ provides the protected
•	keyword. The result is that derived classes get access to such members, but outsiders are still restricted.
•	: public Spaceship is colon syntax
