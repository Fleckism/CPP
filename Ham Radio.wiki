The three things a repeater MAY require, A Transmit Frequency, A Receiver Frequency and a PL (Motorola) tone. 
Usually, a Repeater will have an OFFSET of approximately .600MHz either UP(+) or DOWN (-) from the Receiver 
Frequency so that the Repeater is transmitting as quickly as it receives the signal. 
This prevents a DELAY in actual transmissions.

Emergency channel For CB's in the US, channel 19 is 27.185 MHz, on the AM mode.
